sassafras_longevity_if2days.csv - Ruby Stephens - added 2022-10-31 - manually changed field data from Sassafras Gully to check effect on sampling flowers every 2 days rather than every day

Joly&Schoen_SupplementaryDataset.csv - Simon Joly and Daniel Schoen - added 2023-06-06 - supplementary data on floral symmetry assembled from multiple sources and provided with the paper Joly, S., & Schoen, D. J. (2021). Repeated evolution of a reproductive polyphenism in plants is strongly associated with bilateral flower symmetry. Current Biology. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2021.01.009

Yoder_et_al._(2020)_plant_degree-sharing.csv - Jeremy Yoder, Giancarlo Gomez and Colin Carlson - added 2023-06-06 - supplementary data on floral symmetry assembled from various sources and available with the paper Yoder, J. B., Gomez, G., & Carlson, C. J. (2020). Zygomorphic flowers have fewer potential pollinator species. Biology Letters, 16(9), 20200307. https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2020.0307

aus_symmetry_20210423.csv - Ruby Stephens - added 2023-06-06 - floral (perianth) symmetry scored between 2020-2021 for Australian native and introduced species recorded within plots in the TERN AusPlots network. Symmetry not scored for species without a perianth or suspected of being wind pollinated.

27350_06062023071220_TRY20230606.txt - TRY - added 2023-06-09 - floral symmetry data available from TRY database

Floral_longevity_community_data.csv - Marcos Méndez - added 2023-06-13 - floral longevity data from community studies sent by Marcos Méndez by email on 2023-02-14

Floral_longevity_20230623.xls - Marcos Méndez - added 2023-06-26 - data assembled by Marcos Méndez from numerous studies of floral longevity, sent by email on 2023-06-23: "I attach the data base with floral longevity. I have not been able to complete some data on latitude, longitude and flower size, but at least you have the floral longevities for analysis. As you will see, I "isolated" in a different sheet some data of lower quality, as well as the data of the 6-7 community studies of floral longevity. You can pool them in the main data set if you wish."

Data_for_Dryad.xlsx - Song et al (2022) - added 2023-06-27 - data downloaded from Dryad for the publication: Bo Song, Lu Sun, Spencer C. H. Barrett, Angela T. Moles, Ya-Huang Luo, W. Scott Armbruster, Yong-Qian Gao, Shuang Zhang, Zhi-Qiang Zhang, Hang Sun (2022）Global analysis of floral longevity reveals latitudinal gradients and biotic and abiotic correlates. New Phytologist.
Contains floral longevity data at global scale, row name is species name, family name, country, latitude, elevation, flower size (0.5: <0.5 cm, 1: 0.5-1 cm, 2, 1-2 cm, 4: 2-4 cm; 5: > 4 cm), pollen number, floral longevity, growth form, self compatibility, pollination mode, pollination success index,  temperature of flowering season, solar radiation of flowering season, aridity index of flowering season, references. ** BUT WHY NO LONGITUDE?? **
