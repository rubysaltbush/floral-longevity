# curiously quality=0 in both sheets, what makes low quality sheet lower quality?

# then see, even the lowest quality longevity data can hopefully give some
# clues r.e. floral symmetry

# ultimately patch these three together with some note about where they came from
# (source column), then clean as one


# can defs see some simple orthographic errors in species names, time to try
# matching taxonomy!!! using kewr::match_knms

# Standardization of species names (AccSpeciesName) in TRY version 6: The Plant List 
# has been static since 2013 and is assumed to be outdated. We therefore used the 
# following reference floras for the standardization of species names: World Flora 
# Online (WFO, http://www.worldfloraonline.org/), Leipzig Catalogue of Vascular 
# Plant Names (LCVP, https://idiv-biodiversity.github.io/lcvplants), Tropicos 
# (https://www.tropicos.org), and Index Fungorum (http://www.indexfungorum.org). 
# If a fuzzy match with acceptable levenshtein distance (in general: <2 in the 
# genus, <3 in the epithet) could be established to an accepted name in WFO, this 
# name was used for standardization, else the accepted name in one of the other 
# reference floras was used, if available.
