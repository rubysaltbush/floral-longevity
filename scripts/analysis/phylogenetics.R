# floral symmetry are co-evolving traits

# TO INVESTIGATE
# - randomly sample one species per genus. Same results?
# - use shorter Smith and Brown tree (GBOTB.tre with 79,881 tips)
# - use Smith and Brown without Qian and Jin?? (ALLOTB.tre with 353,185 tips)

# read in short Smith and Brown tree (GBOTB.tre with 79,881 tips)
