# aha yes so it is the outliers, how justified is removing them though?
# WITH DIANELLA ADDED IN SIGNIFICANCE VERY MARGINAL
# for Hybanthus I would think that cleistogamy might be playing a role?? very low insect visitation

# seems like symmetry not the go here, possible that zygomorphic flowers EITHER
# flower for a short time bc good quality visitation OR flower for a long time
# because low frequency of visitation, and you'd need visitation data to know
# this for sure. If longevity is an evolved trait though, what determines it?

# Could I publish a paper that concludes longevity â‰  symmetry? Is this worth
# pursuing?

# Song et al (2022) suggest that longevity is more influenced by components of 
# male than female fitness - so, flowers putting more effort into pollen export
# will last longer than flowers more focussed on pollen receipt. How could you test
# this idea?

# quick test between longevity and plant height out of curiosity, not that
# I've sampled a large range of plant heights

# looks like some signal here for flower size? might be spurious tho

# other q's - does floral longevity = leaf longevity?
# really need to think about this all more at a later date
