## Re-running analysis

Using RStudio open [main.R](https://github.com/rubysaltbush/floral-longevity/blob/main/main.R) 
and run scripts in order given in this main script.

Necessary packages can be installed by running [install_dependencies.R](https://github.com/rubysaltbush/floral-longevity/blob/main/scripts/install_dependencies.R).
Check package versions mentioned in this script are consistent with your installed versions. 
Originally run in R version 4.3.0

The code caches several steps of the data cleaning and results.

Feel free to re-use scripts and functions for your own analyses, e.g.

[arclabel.R](https://github.com/rubysaltbush/floral-longevity/blob/main/scripts/functions/arclabel.R) adds custom labels to circular phylogenies by providing the tips to draw the label between
